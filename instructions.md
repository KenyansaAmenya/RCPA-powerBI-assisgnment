Hello everyone,

You’ve been assigned to groups for the Data Analytics, Data Science, and AI program. Group leaders must create a Cliq group with all members today and share the group link in the main channel.

## Dataset
You’ll use the workbook “JOTFORMS TRIAL v1.xlsx”. It contains:
• RCPA reporting records (doctor/pharmacy visits, weekly prescriptions for our brands and competitors)
• Product master (product codes, descriptions, divisions)
• Brand targets (monthly targets per product)
• An example of the expected transformation to guide you in cleaning/normalizing the data

## Your Task

Collaborate in your Cliq group.

Clean and structure the data as needed for analysis.

Build a Power BI dashboard that shows important charts, insights, and KPIs from the data.

Write a brief summary (1–2 pages) of key findings and recommendations.

## Submission
• Submit: the .pbix file and the brief summary (PDF or Doc).
• Naming: Group<Number>_<LeaderLastName>_RCPA_Dashboard.pbix. NB: List only the members who participated in the group discussion when submitting
• Deadline: Wednesday 22nd October by 5 pm.
• Where to submit: group leaders should send the assignment to breechep@luxdevhq.com

## Expectations
• Accuracy: numbers and joins must be correct and reproducible.
• Clarity: the dashboard should be intuitive, with clear labels and readable visuals.
• Insight: highlight what matters—where we’re strong/weak, notable competitive patterns, and actionable recommendations.
• Teamwork: ensure all members contribute (we may ask for quick check-ins per group).
